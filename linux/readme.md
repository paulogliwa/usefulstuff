# General Knowledge
- To make your script (ex. `myscrpt`) available system-wide, put it in ```/usr/bin/myscrpt``` and make it executable ```chmod +x myscrpt```   
- ```type nameOfSomething``` will show what it is and where it can be found
- `script fileName.txt` will start recoring all console output to fileName.txt without redirecting it. To stop recording type `exit`
